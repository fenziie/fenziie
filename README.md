### Hello, stranger.

My name is Callum, and I am professional grass-hater and amateur programmer. I love Minecraft, have played it for over 10 years and base most of my coding projects around it. I like programming in Java, Kotlin, sometimes C or Assembly as well. If you would like to chat with me, feel free to send me a Discord friend request at "zeeplockd". Thanks for reading!
